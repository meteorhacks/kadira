### Getting started

1. If you don't already have a Galaxy account, sign up [here](https://www.meteor.com/hosting).
2. Run `meteor add mdg:meteor-apm-agent` inside your Meteor project.
3. Once you have deployed your app, enable "Galaxy Professional" from the app settings page.

Now your app will send information to Meteor APM. Visit [Galaxy](https://galaxy.meteor.com) to find links to your APM dashboard.  Links can be found in the following places:
- In the *Performance* area on the App Overview & Containers pages.
- In the *Galaxy Professional* area on the App Settings page.

Wait up to one minute and then data should begin appearing.
